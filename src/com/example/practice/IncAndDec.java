            INCREMENTING AND DECREMENTING
            in this section, we will apply the increment and decrement operators

            1. Create an integer variable that stores the value 10

            2. using System.out.println(), output "Initial value: " followed by the value of this variable

            3. then use the increment operator on this variable
            followed by another System.out.println() call with the output "Value after incrementation: "
            followed by the value of the variable

            4. Then repeat step 3 with the decrement operator
            (make sure to adjust the string output appropriately)
